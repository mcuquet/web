## [`classical-crypto`](https://github.com/mcuquet/classical-crypto)

A small collection of classical cryptography ciphers I wrote some time ago
while learning Perl.

## [`QITools-mathematica`](https://github.com/mcuquet/QITools-mathematica)

A Quantum Information Theory toolkit for Mathematica. I still have some
functions waiting to be included, mainly those related to Graph Theory.

## Miscellanea

* My [.vimrc]({{site.assetsurl}}vimrc) file.
* [A bunch of LaTeX commands]({{site.assetsurl}}qphys.sty), mainly related to
  quantum information stuff. There are also two companion scripts:
  [`qphys2file`]({{site.assetsurl}}qphys2file.pl) to extract the "qphys"
  commands used in a LaTeX file, and [`unqphys`]({{site.assetsurl}}unqphys.pl),
  to actually include the definitions in the file so any dependency on the
  `qphys.sty` is gone.
* [`cleanlatex`]({{site.assetsurl}}cleanlatex.pl) removes files created by
  LaTeX, e.g. `.aux` and `.toc`.
