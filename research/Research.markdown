I am a researcher in [data
science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) at the [Semantic
Technology Institute Innsbruck](http://sti-innsbruck.at/).
Before that, I was a researcher in [quantum information
theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information_theory). I was---and
still am---interested in multipartite entanglement and complex networks.

I studied [physics](http://www.uab.es/departament/fisica/) at [Universitat
Autònoma de Barcelona](http://www.uab.cat/), spending the last year in
[Pisa](http://www.unipi.it/), where I did the Tesi di Laurea Specialistica. I
have a [MSc in Photonics](http://www.photonicsbcn.eu/) from [Universitat
Politècnica de Catalunya](http://www.upc.edu/).

I obtained my PhD at the [Quantum Information
Group](http://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/giq/) in [Universitat Autònoma de
Barcelona](http://www.uab.cat/), under the supervision of [John
Calsamiglia](http://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/giq/people/john-calsamiglia). The
title of my thesis was ["Entanglement distribution in quantum complex
networks"](Entanglement distribution in quantum complex networks).

I also had a postdoctoral position at the [Quantum Information Theory
group](http://www.uibk.ac.at/th-physik/qig_bk/) of [Barbara
Kraus](http://www.uibk.ac.at/th-physik/people/staffdb/354400.xml) in
[Innsbruck](http://uibk.ac.at/).

## [PhD thesis: Entanglement distribution in quantum complex networks](Entanglement distribution in quantum complex networks)

This thesis deals with the study of quantum networks with a complex structure,
the implications this structure has in the distribution of entanglement and
how their functioning can be enhanced by operating in the quantum regime.

### The source and accessible entanglement of few-body systems

Entanglement is the resource to overcome the natural limitations of spatially
separated parties restricted to Local Operations assisted by Classical
Communications (LOCC). Recently two new classes of operational entanglement
measures, the source and the accessible entanglement, for arbitrary
multipartite states have been introduced. Whereas the source entanglement
measures from how many states the state of interest can be obtained via LOCC,
the accessible entanglement measures how many states can be reached via LOCC
from the state at hand. We consider here pure bipartite as well as
multipartite states and derive explicit formulae for the source entanglement.
Moreover, we obtain explicit formulae for a whole class of source entanglement
measures that characterize the simplicity of generating a given bipartite pure
state via LOCC. Furthermore, we show how the accessible entanglement can be
computed numerically. For generic four-qubit states we first derive the
necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of LOCC transformations
among these states and then derive explicit formulae for their accessible and
source entanglement.

[arXiv:1503.00615](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00615)

We introduce two operational entanglement measures which are applicable for
arbitrary multipartite (pure or mixed) states. One of them characterizes the
potentiality of a state to generate other states via local operations assisted
by classical communication (LOCC) and the other the simplicity of generating
the state at hand. We show how these measures can be generalized to two
classes of entanglement measures. Moreover, we compute the new measures for
few-partite systems and use them to characterize the entanglement contained in
a three-qubit state. We identify the GHZ- and the W-state as the most powerful
three-qubit states regarding state manipulation.

Hypergraph states are multi-qubit states that form a subset of the locally
maximally entangleable states and a generalization of the well-established
notion of graph states. Mathematically, they can conveniently be described by
a hypergraph that indicates a possible generation procedure of these states;
alternatively, they can also be phrased in terms of a non-local stabilizer
formalism. In this paper, we explore the entanglement properties and
nonclassical features of hypergraph states. First, we identify the equivalence
classes under local unitary transformations for up to four qubits, as well as
important classes of five- and six-qubit states, and determine various
entanglement properties of these classes. Second, we present general
conditions under which the local unitary equivalence of hypergraph states can
simply be decided by considering a finite set of transformations with a clear
graph-theoretical interpretation. Finally, we consider the question whether
hypergraph states and their correlations can be used to reveal contradictions
with classical hidden variable theories. We demonstrate that various
noncontextuality inequalities and Bell inequalities can be derived for
hypergraph states.

### Growth of graph states in quantum networks

Martí Cuquet and John Calsamiglia

[Physical Review A 86, 042304 (2012)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.86.042304)

[arXiv:1208.0710](http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0710)

We propose a scheme to distribute graph states over quantum networks in the
presence of noise in the channels and in the operations. The protocol can be
implemented efficiently for large graph sates of arbitrary (complex) topology.
We benchmark our scheme with two protocols where each connected component is
prepared in a node belonging to the component and subsequently distributed via
quantum repeaters to the remaining connected nodes. We show that the fidelity
of the generated graphs can be written as the partition function of a
classical Ising-type Hamiltonian. We give exact expressions of the fidelity of
the linear cluster and results for its decay rate in random graphs with
arbitrary (uncorrelated) degree distributions.

### Limited-path-length entanglement percolation in quantum complex networks

Martí Cuquet and John Calsamiglia

[Physical Review A 83, 032319 (2011)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.83.032319)

[arXiv:1011.5630](http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5630)

We study entanglement distribution in quantum complex networks where nodes are
connected by bipartite entangled states. These networks are characterized by a
complex structure, which dramatically affects how information is transmitted
through them. For pure quantum state links, quantum networks exhibit a
remarkable feature absent in classical networks: it is possible to effectively
rewire the network by performing local operations on the nodes. We propose a
family of such quantum operations that decrease the entanglement percolation
threshold of the network and increase the size of the giant connected
component. We provide analytic results for complex networks with an arbitrary
(uncorrelated) degree distribution. These results are in good agreement with
numerical simulations, which also show enhancement in correlated and
real-world networks. The proposed quantum preprocessing strategies are not
robust in the presence of noise. However, even when the links consist of
(noisy) mixed-state links, one can send quantum information through a
connecting path with a fidelity that decreases with the path length. In this
noisy scenario, complex networks offer a clear advantage over regular
lattices, namely, the fact that two arbitrary nodes can be connected through a
relatively small number of steps, known as the small-world effect. We
calculate the probability that two arbitrary nodes in the network can
successfully communicate with a fidelity above a given threshold. This amounts
to working out the classical problem of percolation with a limited path
length. We find that this probability can be significant even for paths
limited to few connections and that the results for standard (unlimited)
percolation are soon recovered if the path length exceeds by a finite amount
the average path length, which in complex networks generally scales
logarithmically with the size of the network.

### Entanglement Percolation in Quantum Complex Networks

Martí Cuquet and John Calsamiglia

[Physical Review Letters 103, 240503 (2009)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.240503)

[arXiv:0906.2977](http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.2977)

Quantum networks are essential to quantum information distributed
applications, and communicating over them is a key challenge. Complex networks
have rich and intriguing properties, which are as yet unexplored in the
quantum setting. Here, we study the effect of entanglement percolation as a
means to establish long-distance entanglement between arbitrary nodes of
quantum complex networks. We develop a theory to analytically study random
graphs with arbitrary degree distribution and give exact results for some
models. Our findings are in good agreement with numerical simulations and show
that the proposed quantum strategies enhance the percolation threshold
substantially. Simulations also show a clear enhancement in small-world and
other real-world networks.
